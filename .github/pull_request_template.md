<!-- if your edit is to something other than all-repos.yaml remove this -->

my new repository:

- [ ] is added to the bottom *or* with existing repos from the same account
- [ ] contains a license
- [ ] is not `language: system`, `language: script`, or `language: docker` (the former two are not portable)
- [ ] does not contain "pre-commit" in the name (it's not officially associated)
