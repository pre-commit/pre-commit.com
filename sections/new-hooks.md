pre-commit currently supports hooks written in
[many languages](#supported-languages). As long as your git repo is an
installable package (gem, npm, pypi, etc.) or exposes an executable, it can be
used with pre-commit. Each git repo can support as many languages/hooks as you
want.

The hook must exit nonzero on failure or modify files.

A git repo containing pre-commit plugins must contain a `.pre-commit-hooks.yaml`
file that tells pre-commit:

```table
=r=
    =c= [`id`](_#hooks-id)
    =c= the id of the hook - used in pre-commit-config.yaml.
=r=
    =c= [`name`](_#hooks-name)
    =c= the name of the hook - shown during hook execution.
=r=
    =c= [`entry`](_#hooks-entry)
    =c= the entry point - the executable to run.  `entry` can also contain
        arguments that will not be overridden such as `entry: autopep8 -i`.
=r=
    =c= [`language`](_#hooks-language)
    =c= the language of the hook - tells pre-commit how to install the hook.
=r=
    =c= [`files`](_#hooks-files)
    =c= (optional: default `''`) the pattern of files to run on.
=r=
    =c= [`exclude`](_#hooks-exclude)
    =c= (optional: default `^$`)  exclude files that were matched by [`files`](#hooks-files).
=r=
    =c= [`types`](_#hooks-types)
    =c= (optional: default `[file]`)  list of file types to run on (AND).  See
        [Filtering files with types](#filtering-files-with-types).
=r=
    =c= [`types_or`](_#hooks-types_or)
    =c= (optional: default `[]`)  list of file types to run on (OR).  See
        [Filtering files with types](#filtering-files-with-types).
        _new in 2.9.0_.
=r=
    =c= [`exclude_types`](_#hooks-exclude_types)
    =c= (optional: default `[]`)  the pattern of files to exclude.
=r=
    =c= [`always_run`](_#hooks-always_run)
    =c= (optional: default `false`) if `true` this hook will run even if there
        are no matching files.
=r=
    =c= [`fail_fast`](_#hooks-fail_fast)
    =c= (optional: default `false`) if `true` pre-commit will stop running
        hooks if this hook fails.  _new in 2.16.0_.
=r=
    =c= [`verbose`](_#hooks-verbose)
    =c= (optional: default `false`) if `true`, forces the output of the hook to be printed even when
        the hook passes.
=r=
    =c= [`pass_filenames`](_#hooks-pass_filenames)
    =c= (optional: default `true`) if `false` no filenames will be passed to
        the hook.
=r=
    =c= [`require_serial`](_#hooks-require_serial)
    =c= (optional: default `false`) if `true` this hook will execute using a
        single process instead of in parallel.
=r=
    =c= [`description`](_#hooks-description)
    =c= (optional: default `''`) description of the hook.  used for metadata
        purposes only.
=r=
    =c= [`language_version`](_#hooks-language_version)
    =c= (optional: default `default`) see

        compatible pre-commit version.
=r=
    =c= [`args`](_#hooks-args)
    =c= (optional: default `[]`) list of additional parameters to pass to the hook.
=r=
    =c= [`stages`](_#hooks-stages)
    =c= (optional: default (all stages)) selects which git hook(s) to run for.
        See [Confining hooks to run at certain stages](#confining-hooks-to-run-at-certain-stages).

```

For example:

```yaml
-   id: trailing-whitespace
    name: Trim Trailing Whitespace
    description: This hook trims trailing whitespace.
    entry: trailing-whitespace-fixer
    language: python
    types: [text]
```

## Developing hooks interactively

Since the [`repo`](#repos-repo) property of `.pre-commit-config.yaml` can refer to anything
that `git clone ...` understands, it's often useful to point it at a local
directory while developing hooks.

[`pre-commit try-repo`](#pre-commit-try-repo) streamlines this process by
enabling a quick way to try out a repository.  Here's how one might work
interactively:

_note_: you may need to provide `--commit-msg-filename` when using this
command with hook types `prepare-commit-msg` and `commit-msg`.

a commit is not necessary to `try-repo` on a local
directory. `pre-commit` will clone any tracked uncommitted changes.

```pre-commit
~/work/hook-repo $ git checkout origin/main -b feature

# ... make some changes

# In another terminal or tab

~/work/other-repo $ pre-commit try-repo ../hook-repo foo --verbose --all-files
===============================================================================
Using config:
===============================================================================
repos:
-   repo: ../hook-repo
    rev: 84f01ac09fcd8610824f9626a590b83cfae9bcbd
    hooks:
    -   id: foo
===============================================================================
[INFO] Initializing environment for ../hook-repo.
Foo......................................................................Passed
- hook id: foo
- duration: 0.02s

Hello from foo hook!

```

- [system](#system)

### conda

The hook repository must contain an `environment.yml` file which will be used
via `conda env create --file environment.yml ...` to create the environment.

The `conda` language also supports [`additional_dependencies`](#config-additional_dependencies)
and will pass any of the values directly into `conda install`.  This language can therefore be
used with [local](#repository-local-hooks) hooks.

_new in 2.17.0_: `mamba` or `micromamba` can be used to install instead via the
`PRE_COMMIT_USE_MAMBA=1` or `PRE_COMMIT_USE_MICROMAMBA=1` environment
variables.

__Support:__ `conda` hooks work as long as there is a system-installed `conda`
binary (such as [`miniconda`](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)).
It has been tested on linux, macOS, and windows.

### coursier

_new in 2.8.0_

The hook repository must have a `.pre-commit-channel` folder and that folder
must contain the coursier
[application descriptors](https://get-coursier.io/docs/2.0.0-RC6-10/cli-install.html#application-descriptor-reference)
for the hook to install. For configuring coursier hooks, your
[`entry`](#hooks-entry) should correspond to an executable installed from the
repository's `.pre-commit-channel` folder.

__Support:__ `coursier` hooks are known to work on any system which has the
`cs` or `coursier` package manager installed. The specific coursier
applications you install may depend on various versions of the JVM, consult
the hooks' documentation for clarification.  It has been tested on linux.

_new in 2.18.0_: pre-commit now supports the `coursier` naming of the package
manager executable.

_new in 3.0.0_: `language: coursier` hooks now support `repo: local` and
`additional_dependencies`.

### dart

_new in 2.15.0_

The hook repository must have a `pubspec.yaml` -- this must contain an
`executables` section which will list the binaries that will be available
after installation.  Match the [`entry`](#hooks-entry) to an executable.

`pre-commit` will build each executable using `dart compile exe bin/{executable}.dart`.

`language: dart` also supports [`additional_dependencies`](#config-additional_dependencies).
to specify a version for a dependency, separate the package name by a `:`:

```yaml
        additional_dependencies: ['hello_world_dart:1.0.0']
```

__Support:__ `dart` hooks are known to work on any system which has the `dart`
sdk installed.  It has been tested on linux, macOS, and windows.

### docker

The hook repository must have a `Dockerfile`.  It will be installed via
`docker build .`.

Running Docker hooks requires a running Docker engine on your host.  For
configuring Docker hooks, your [`entry`](#hooks-entry) should correspond to an executable
inside the Docker container, and will be used to override the default container
entrypoint. Your Docker `CMD` will not run when pre-commit passes a file list
as arguments to the run container command. Docker allows you to use any
language that's not supported by pre-commit as a builtin.

pre-commit will automatically mount the repository source as a volume using
`-v $PWD:/src:rw,Z` and set the working directory using `--workdir /src`.

__Support:__ docker hooks are known to work on any system which has a working
`docker` executable.  It has been tested on linux and macOS.  Hooks that are
run via `boot2docker` are known to be unable to make modifications to files.

See [this repository](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-docker-flake8)
for an example Docker-based hook.

### docker_image

A more lightweight approach to `docker` hooks.  The `docker_image`
"language" uses existing docker images to provide hook executables.

`docker_image` hooks can be conveniently configured as [local](#repository-local-hooks)
hooks.

The [`entry`](#hooks-entry) specifies the docker tag to use.  If an image has an
`ENTRYPOINT` defined, nothing special is needed to hook up the executable.
If the container does not specify an `ENTRYPOINT` or you want to change the
entrypoint you can specify it as well in your [`entry`](#hooks-entry).

For example:

```yaml
-   id: dockerfile-provides-entrypoint
    name: ...
    language: docker_image
    entry: my.registry.example.com/docker-image-1:latest
-   id: dockerfile-no-entrypoint-1
    name: ...
    language: docker_image
    entry: --entrypoint my-exe my.registry.example.com/docker-image-2:latest
# Alternative equivalent solution
-   id: dockerfile-no-entrypoint-2
    name: ...
    language: docker_image
    entry: my.registry.example.com/docker-image-3:latest my-exe
```

### dotnet

_new in 2.8.0_

dotnet hooks are installed using the system installation of the dotnet CLI.

Hook repositories must contain a dotnet CLI tool which can be `pack`ed and
`install`ed as per [this](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/global-tools-how-to-create)
example. The `entry` should match an executable created by building the
repository. Additional dependencies are not currently supported.

__Support:__ dotnet hooks are known to work on any system which has the dotnet
CLI installed.  It has been tested on linux and windows.

### fail

A lightweight [`language`](#hooks-language) to forbid files by filename.  The `fail` language is
especially useful for [local](#repository-local-hooks) hooks.

The [`entry`](#hooks-entry) will be printed when the hook fails.  It is suggested to provide
a brief description for [`name`](#hooks-name) and more verbose fix instructions in [`entry`](#hooks-entry).

Here's an example which prevents any file except those ending with `.rst` from
being added to the `changelog` directory:

```yaml
-   repo: local
    hooks:
    -   id: changelogs-rst
        name: changelogs must be rst
        entry: changelog filenames must end in .rst
        language: fail
        files: 'changelog/.*(?<!\.rst)$'
```

### golang

The hook repository must contain go source code.  It will be installed via
`go install ./...`.  pre-commit will create an isolated `GOPATH` for each hook
and the [`entry`](#hooks-entry) should match an executable which will get installed into the
`GOPATH`'s `bin` directory.

_changed in 2.17.0_: previously `go get ./...` was used

_new in 3.0.0_: pre-commit will bootstrap `go` if it is not present. `language: golang`
also now supports `language_version`

__Support:__ golang hooks are known to work on any system which has go
installed.  It has been tested on linux, macOS, and windows.

### lua

_new in 2.17.0_

Lua hooks are installed with the version of Lua that is used by Luarocks.

__Support:__ Lua hooks are known to work on any system which has Luarocks
installed.  It has been tested on linux and macOS and _may_ work on windows.

### node

The hook repository must have a `package.json`.  It will be installed via
`npm install .`.  The installed package will provide an executable that will
match the [`entry`](#hooks-entry) – usually through `bin` in package.json.

__Support:__ node hooks work without any system-level dependencies.  It has
been tested on linux, windows, and macOS and _may_ work under cygwin.

### perl

_new in 2.1.0_

Perl hooks are installed using the system installation of
[cpan](https://perldoc.perl.org/cpan), the CPAN package installer
that comes with Perl.

Hook repositories must have something that `cpan` supports, typically
`Makefile.PL` or `Build.PL`, which it uses to install an executable to
use in the [`entry`](#hooks-entry) definition for your hook. The repository will be installed
via `cpan -T .` (with the installed files stored in your pre-commit cache,
not polluting other Perl installations).

When specifying [`additional_dependencies`](#config-additional_dependencies) for Perl, you can use any of the
[install argument formats understood by `cpan`](https://perldoc.perl.org/CPAN#get%2c-make%2c-test%2c-install%2c-clean-modules-or-distributions).

__Support:__ Perl hooks currently require a pre-existing Perl installation,
including the `cpan` tool in `PATH`.  It has been tested on linux, macOS, and
Windows.

### python

The hook repository must be installable via `pip install .` (usually by either
`setup.py` or `pyproject.toml`).  The installed package will provide an
executable that will match the [`entry`](#hooks-entry) – usually through `console_scripts` or
`scripts` in setup.py.

__Support:__ python hooks work without any system-level dependencies.  It
has been tested on linux, macOS, windows, and cygwin.

### python_venv

_new in 2.4.0_: The `python_venv` language is now an alias to `python` since
`virtualenv>=20` creates equivalently structured environments.  Previously,
this [`language`](#hooks-language) created environments using the [venv] module.

This [`language`](#hooks-language) will be removed eventually so it is suggested to use `python`
instead.

[venv]: https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html

__Support:__ python hooks work without any system-level dependencies.  It
has been tested on linux, macOS, windows, and cygwin.

### r

_new in 2.11.0_

This hook repository must have a `renv.lock` file that will be restored with
[`renv::restore()`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/reference/restore.html) on
hook installation. If the repository is an R package (i.e. has `Type: Package`
in `DESCRIPTION`), it is installed. The supported syntax in [`entry`](#hooks-entry) is
`Rscript -e {expression}` or `Rscript path/relative/to/hook/root`. The
R Startup process is skipped (emulating `--vanilla`), as all configuration
should be exposed via [`args`](#hooks-args) for maximal transparency and portability.

When specifying [`additional_dependencies`](#config-additional_dependencies)
for R, you can use any of the install argument formats understood by
[`renv::install()`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/reference/install.html#examples).

__Support:__ `r` hooks work as long as [`R`](https://www.r-project.org) is
installed and on `PATH`. It has been tested on linux, macOS, and windows.


### ruby

The hook repository must have a `*.gemspec`.  It will be installed via
`gem build *.gemspec && gem install *.gem`.  The installed package will
produce an executable that will match the [`entry`](#hooks-entry) – usually through
`executables` in your gemspec.

__Support:__ ruby hooks work without any system-level dependencies.  It has
been tested on linux and macOS and _may_ work under cygwin.

### rust

Rust hooks are installed using [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo),
Rust's official package manager.

Hook repositories must have a `Cargo.toml` file which produces at least one
binary ([example](https://github.com/chriskuehl/example-rust-pre-commit-hook)),
whose name should match the [`entry`](#hooks-entry) definition for your hook. The repo will be
installed via `cargo install --bins` (with the binaries stored in your
pre-commit cache, not polluting your user-level Cargo installations).

When specifying [`additional_dependencies`](#config-additional_dependencies) for Rust, you can use the syntax
`{package_name}:{package_version}` to specify a new library dependency (used to
build _your_ hook repo), or the special syntax
`cli:{package_name}:{package_version}` for a CLI dependency (built separately,
with binaries made available for use by hooks).

_new in 2.21.0_: pre-commit will bootstrap `rust` if it is not present.
`language: rust` also now supports `language_version`

__Support:__ It has been tested on linux, Windows, and macOS.

### swift

The hook repository must have a `Package.swift`.  It will be installed via
`swift build -c release`.  The [`entry`](#hooks-entry) should match an executable created by
building the repository.

__Support:__ swift hooks are known to work on any system which has swift
installed.  It has been tested on linux and macOS.

### pygrep

A cross-platform python implementation of `grep` – pygrep hooks are a quick
way to write a simple hook which prevents commits by file matching.  Specify
the regex as the [`entry`](#hooks-entry).  The [`entry`](#hooks-entry) may be any python
[regular expression](#regular-expressions).  For case insensitive regexes you
can apply the `(?i)` flag as the start of your entry, or use `args: [-i]`.

For multiline matches, use `args: [--multiline]`.

_new in 2.8.0_: To require all files to match, use `args: [--negate]`.

__Support:__ pygrep hooks are supported on all platforms which pre-commit runs
on.

### script

Script hooks provide a way to write simple scripts which validate files. The
[`entry`](#hooks-entry) should be a path relative to the root of the hook repository.

This hook type will not be given a virtual environment to work with – if it
needs additional dependencies the consumer must install them manually.

__Support:__ the support of script hooks depend on the scripts themselves.

### system

System hooks provide a way to write hooks for system-level executables which
don't have a supported language above (or have special environment
requirements that don't allow them to run in isolation such as pylint).

This hook type will not be given a virtual environment to work with – if it
needs additional dependencies the consumer must install them manually.

__Support:__ the support of system hooks depend on the executables.
