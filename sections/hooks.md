## finding hooks

it's recommended to use your favorite searching tool to find existing hooks to
use in your project.

for example, here's some searches you may find useful using [sourcegraph]:

- hooks which run on python files: [`file:^\.pre-commit-hooks\.yaml$ "types: [python]"`](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+file:^\.pre-commit-hooks\.yaml%24+%22types:+[python]%22)
- hooks which run on shell files: [`file:^\.pre-commit-hooks\.yaml$ "types: [shell]"`](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+file:^\.pre-commit-hooks\.yaml%24+"types:+[shell]")
- pre-commit configurations in popular projects: [`file:^\.pre-commit-config\.yaml$`](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+file:^\.pre-commit-hooks\.yaml%24+"types:+[shell]")

[sourcegraph]: https://sourcegraph.com/search

you may also find [github's search] useful as well, though its querying and
sorting capabilities are quite limited plus it requires a login:

- repositories providing hooks: [`path:.pre-commit-hooks.yaml language:YAML`](https://github.com/search?q=path%3A.pre-commit-hooks.yaml+language%3AYAML&type=code&l=YAML)

## adding to this page

the previous iteration of this page was a laundry list of hooks and maintaining
quality of the listed tools was cumbersome.

**this page is not intended to be exhaustive**

you may send [a pull request] to expand this list however there are a few
requirements you *must* follow or your PR will be closed without comment:

- the tool must already be fairly popular (>500 stars)
- the tool must use a managed language (no `system` / `script` / `docker` hooks)
- the tool must operate on files
